var dataInfoContent = `<h5>Note: properties may have changed ownership since the data was initially collected. There may be some inaccuracies in property matching to ownership â€” see below for more details.</h5>

<p>The <b>property taxpayer</b>  and address for buildings in Cook County were <b>scraped</b> from the <a href="https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/address-search">assessor website</a> in November 2019, and filtered to exclude properties not zoned for rental. Properties were matched based on the name and address of the property taxpayer, to find the <b>number of buildings</b> sharing the same taxpayer. It is possible some buildings owned by a single taxpayer will be missing from the set of buildings matching that same taxpayer, as companies may have multiple names and addresses associated with their different properties.</p>

<p>For owners affiliated with at least 5 properties, matches were researched and <b>affiliated</b> with particular corporations, managers, or landlords based on information in the <a href="https://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController">Illinois Secretary of State LLC Search</a> and other public records, including the <a href="https://cookrecorder.com/search-our-records/">Cook County Recorder of Deeds</a>. There may be some inaccuracy in matching between taxpayers who have similar names or similar addresses, especially for owners with 4 properties or fewer.</p> 

<p>Estimated unit counts for landlords were based on data from the Chicago Department of Buildings as well as the 'property class' as defined by the Cook County Assessor's Office.</p>`
